A **symbol** is a data type that represents unique, unforgeable identifiers. They are sometimes called _atoms_.

In JavaScript, `symbol` is one of the [primitives](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) and can be created using the [`Symbol()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) factory method that returns a different symbol each time. They can be used as keys for maps.
